# Summary

Split `astro` into a set of independently usable Vite plugins — the `.astro` language, a pages router, and one plugin per feature — and rebuild the `astro` CLI as a composition of them.

# Example

**Just the language** — Astro components rendered by Hono routes, with a React island:

```js
// vite.config.js
import astro from '@astrojs/vite-plugin-astro';
import react from '@astrojs/react/renderer';

export default {
  plugins: [
    astro({
      renderers: [react()],
    }),
  ],
};
```

```ts
// src/app.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { renderToResponse } from '@astrojs/runtime';
import Page from './components/Page.astro';

const app = new Hono();

app.get('/hello/:name', (c) => renderToResponse(Page, { props: { name: c.req.param('name') } }));
```

**Pages** — a site with file routing and nothing else:

```js
import astro from '@astrojs/vite-plugin-astro';
import pages from '@astrojs/vite-plugin-pages';

export default { plugins: [astro(), pages()] }; // vite dev / vite build
```

**Pick your features:**

```js
export default {
  plugins: [
    astro({ site: 'https://example.com' }),
    pages({ output: 'server' }),
    content(),
    markdown(),
    assets(),
    i18n({ defaultLocale: 'en', locales: ['en', 'es'] }),
    // no actions, no sessions, no toolbar
  ],
};
```

# Background & Motivation

Astro has become a collection of strong primitives — the `.astro` component language, islands, file-based routing, content collections, actions, i18n, sessions, image optimization, fonts — delivered as a single package with a single CLI.

However currently using this is an all-or-nothing proposition. If you want to use something else for a particular task you can, but you will incur the cost in package size nonetheless, which often pushes you towards using the built-in primitives. For Astro this presents a risk, if the perception of any of the parts is negative it can lead to negative feelings about the framework as a whole.

Additionally, many projects do not start out using Astro, but they do start out using Vite. Making Astro available as a plugin lets those people *upgrade* to use Astro without rewriting their entire application.

This proposal grew out of [Standalone `.astro` file usage](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap/discussions/1378), which asked for `.astro` files to be usable in plain Vite projects. A prototype ([withastro/astro#17094](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/17094), tried out in [web-runes/vite-deploy#47](https://github.com/web-runes/vite-deploy/pull/47)) showed that compiling `.astro` files in a separate plugin is straightforward, but that rendering them, especially islands and styles, depends on runtime metadata that today only the full framework provides. This RFC widens the scope from the language alone to every feature, so that the plugin boundaries are designed together.

# Goals

- Make it possible to use Astro in all Vite projects, and to use Astro itself in [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev/).
- Make it possible to use Astro islands in non-Astro projects, like in a mostly-api app that uses Hono.
  - Related, using Astro for the "marketing site" of a SPA that is using something else.
- Allow sites to choose non-Astro based tools when Astro tools already exist; for example building an Astro site that includes an RPC library, such as TRPC without the burden of also having Astro Actions installed.
- Reducing the overall filesize of typical Astro applications.
- Set us up for Astro 8 in which we could trim the `astro` package itself.

## Stretch goals

- A single "all-in-one" plugin that enables every feature, for Vite users who want the whole framework without listing each plugin.

# Non-Goals

- Changing what `astro` does for existing users, the `.astro` language, the integration API, or the adapter API.
- Replacing integrations with Vite plugins. Integrations remain the extension mechanism of the full framework; the plugins are a lower layer the framework is built on.
- Extracting features into framework-agnostic cores (e.g. content collections for non-Astro use). Possible later; out of scope here.
- Supporting bundlers other than Vite. There will be a separate package for the runtime so this is theoretically possible but not something worth pursuing.
- Running any existing `.astro` file unmodified outside of the full framework. Framework features such as tsconfig path aliasing are not part of the language plugin; islands, styles, and view transition directives are.

# Detailed Design

<!-- TODO -->

## Packages

<!-- TODO: list each package, what it contains, and its name. -->

## The language plugin

<!-- TODO: compiling .astro, HMR, styles, and the metadata islands need. -->

## The runtime

<!-- TODO: @astrojs/runtime and renderToResponse; how island and style metadata reach it. -->

## Renderers

<!-- TODO: how framework renderers (React, Vue, ...) plug into the language plugin. -->

## The pages plugin

<!-- TODO: file routing, output modes, adapters. -->

## Feature plugins

<!-- TODO: content, markdown, assets, i18n, actions, sessions, fonts, toolbar, and their dependencies. -->

## Shared configuration

<!-- TODO: how plugins share config (e.g. `site`) and discover each other. -->

## The astro CLI and integrations

<!-- TODO: how astro.config.mjs and integrations map onto the plugins. -->

# Unresolved Questions

- How do plugins share configuration and find each other? For example, how does `pages()` learn `site` from `astro()`?
- What is the `@astrojs/runtime` API, and how does island and style metadata reach it without the full framework?
- How do `astro.config.mjs` and the integration API map onto the plugins?
- Package naming: `@astrojs/vite-plugin-*` (as in the examples) or unscoped `vite-plugin-astro` (as in the prototype, to match plugins like `vite-plugin-react`)?
- Which features depend on each other (e.g. does `content()` require `markdown()`?), and how is a missing dependency reported?
