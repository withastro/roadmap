# Summary

Have first-party support for fonts in Astro.

# Example

```js
// astro config
export default defineConfig({
  fonts: {
    families: ["Roboto", "Lato"],
  },
});
```

```astro
---
// layouts/Layout.astro
import { Font } from 'astro:fonts'
---
<head>
	<Font family='Inter' preload />
	<Font family='Lato' />
	<style>
		h1 {
			font-family: var(--astro-font-inter);
		}
		p {
			font-family: var(--astro-font-lato);
		}
	</style>
</head>
```

# Background & Motivation

Fonts is one of those basic things when making a website, but also an annoying one to deal with. Should I just use a link to a remote font? Or download it locally? How should I handle preloads then?

The goal is to improve the DX around using fonts in Astro.

> Why not using fontsource?

Fontsource is great! But it's not intuitive to preload, and more importantly, doesn't have all fonts. The goal is to have a more generic API for fonts (eg. you want to use a paid provider like adobe).

# Goals

- Specify what font to use
- Cache fonts
- Specify what provider to use
- Load/preload font on a font basis
- Generate fallbacks automatically
- Performant defaults
- Runtime agnostic
- Configure font families (subset, unicode range, weights etc)

# Non-Goals

- Runtime API (SSR is supported tho)
- Automatic subsetting (eg. analyzing static content)
- Automatic font detection (ie. downloading fonts based on font families names used in the user's project)

# Detailed Design

## Astro config

### Overview

The goal is to have a config that starts really simple for basic usecases, but can also be complex for advanced usecases. Here's an example of basic config:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  fonts: {
    families: ["Roboto", "Lato"],
  },
});
```

That would get fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) with sensible defaults.

Here's a more complex example:

```js
import { defineConfig, fontProviders } from "astro/config";
import { myCustomFontProvider } from "./provider";

export default defineConfig({
  fonts: {
    providers: [
      fontProviders.adobe({ apiKey: process.env.ADOBE_FONTS_API_KEY }),
      myCustomFontProvider(),
    ],
    families: [
      "Roboto",
      {
        name: "Lato",
        provider: "google",
        weights: [100, 200, 300],
      },
      {
        name: "Custom",
        provider: "local",
        src: ["./assets/fonts/Custom.woff2"],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

### Providers

#### Definition

A provider allows to retrieve font faces data from a font family name from a given CDN or abstraction. It's an abstraction on top of [unifont](https://github.com/unjs/unifont) providers.

#### Built-in providers

##### Google

This is the default, and it's not configurable. Given the amount of fonts it supports by, it sounds like a logic choice.

```js
export default defineConfig({
  fonts: {
    families: ["Roboto"],
  },
});
```

```js
export default defineConfig({
  fonts: {
    families: [
      {
        name: "Roboto",
        provider: "google",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

##### Local

This provider, unlike all the others, requires specifying fonts paths and properties relatively to the root.

```js
import { defineConfig, fontProviders } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  fonts: {
    families: [
      {
        name: "Custom",
        provider: "local",
        src: [
          {
            weights: ["400"],
            paths: ["./assets/fonts/Custom.woff2"],
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

#### Opt-in providers

Other unifont providers are exported from `astro/config`.

```js
import { defineConfig, fontProviders } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  fonts: {
    providers: [
      fontProviders.adobe({ apiKey: process.env.ADOBE_FONTS_API_KEY }),
    ],
    // ...
  },
});
```

Note that under the hood, the definition would look like:

```ts
function adobe(config: AdobeConfig): FontProvider {
  return {
    name: "adobe",
    entrypoint: "astro/assets/fonts/adobe",
    config,
  };
}

export const fontProviders = {
  adobe,
};
```

#### Why this API?

1. **Coherent API**: a few things in Astro are using this pattern, namely integrations and vite plugins. It's simple to author as a library author, easy to use as a user
2. **Keep opt-in providers**: allows to only use 2 providers by default, and keeps the API open to anyone
3. **Types!**: now that `defineConfig` [supports generics](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/12243), we can do powerful things! Associated with type generation, we can generate types for `families` `name`, infer the provider type from `provider` and more.

### Defaults

Astro must provide sensible defaults when it comes to font weights, subsets and more.

We need to decide what default to provide. I can see 2 paths:

| Path      | Example (weight)    | Advantage             | Downside                                                                          |
| --------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Minimal   | Only include `400`  | Lightweight           | People will probably struggle by expecting all weights to be available by default |
| Extensive | Include all weights | Predictable for users | Heavier by default                                                                |

### Families

A family is made of a least a `name`:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  fonts: {
    families: [
      {
        name: "Roboto",
      },
      "Roboto", // Shorthand
    ],
  },
});
```

It can specify options such as `weights` and `subsets`:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  fonts: {
    families: [
      {
        name: "Roboto",
        weights: [400, 600],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

It can also specify a `provider` (and `src` if it's the `local` provider):

```js
export default defineConfig({
  fonts: {
    families: [
      {
        name: "Roboto",
        provider: "local",
        src: "./Roboto.woff2",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

### Font component

Setting the config (see above) configures what fonts to download, but it doesn't include font automatically on pages. Instead, we provide a `<Font />` component that can be used to compose where and how to load fonts.

```astro
---
import { Font } from "astro:assets"
---
<head>
  <Font family="Inter" preload cssVar="primary-font" />
  <Font family="Lato" />
</head>
```

### Family

The family will be typed using type gen, based on the user's config.

### Preload

Defaults to `false`:

- **Enabled**: Outputs a preload link tag and a style tag, without fallbacks
- **Disabled**: Output a style tag with fallbacks (generated using [fontaine](https://github.com/unjs/fontaine))

### cssVar

Defaults to `astro-font-${computedFontName}`. Specifies what identifier to use for the generated css variable. This is useful for font families names that may contain special character or conflict with other fonts.

## Usage

Since fallbacks may be generated for a given family name, this name can't be used alone reliably:

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "Inter"; /* Should actually be "Inter", "Inter Fallback" */
}
```

To solve this issue, a css variable is provided by the style tage generated by the `<Font />` component:

```css
h1 {
  font-family: var(--astro-font-inter); /* "Inter", "Inter Fallback" */
}
```

## How it works under the hood

- Once the config is fully resolved, we get fonts face data using `unifont`
- We generate fallbacks using `fontaine` and pass all the data we need through a virtual import, used by the `<Font />` component
- We inject a vite middleware in development to download fonts as they are requested in development
- During build, we download all fonts and put them in `outDir`

Data is cached to `cacheDir` for builds and `.astro/fonts` in development.

# Testing Strategy

- Integration tests
- Experimental flag (`experimental.fonts`)

# Drawbacks

I have not identified any outstanding drawback:

- **Implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity**: fine
- **Whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space**: yes
- **Impact on teaching people Astro**: should make things easier, will need updating docs
- **Integration of this feature with other existing and planned features**: reuses `astro:assets` to export the component, otherwise isolated from other features
- **Is it a breaking change?** No

# Alternatives

## As an integration

This feature could be developed as an integration, eg. `@astrojs/fonts`. Making it part of core allows to make it more discoverable, more used. It also allows to use the `astro:assets` module for the `<Font />` component.

## Different API for simpler cases

The following API has been suggested for the simpler cases:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  fonts: ["Roboto"],
});
```

I'd love to support such API where you can provide fonts top level, or inside `fonts.families` but we can't. We can't because of how the integration API `defineConfig()` works. What if a user provides fonts names as `fonts`, and an integration provides fonts names as `fonts.families`? Given how the merging works, the shape of `AstroUserConfig` and `AstroConfig` musn't be too different. It already caused issues with i18n in the past.

# Adoption strategy

- **If we implement this proposal, how will existing Astro developers adopt it?** Fonts setups can vary a lot but migrating to the core fonts api should not require too much work
- **Is this a breaking change? Can we write a codemod?** No
- **How will this affect other projects in the Astro ecosystem?** This should make [`astro-font`](https://github.com/rishi-raj-jain/astro-font) obsolete

# Unresolved Questions

- We need to check if fallbacks should still be included for preloaded fonts
