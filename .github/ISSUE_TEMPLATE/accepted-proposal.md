# Summary

A brief, one or two sentence explanation of the proposal.

# Background & Motivation

Include any useful detail that that explains the background of this problem 
at Astro and why this problem is worth solving. Why solve it now? Be brief!

# Goals

A **concise, bulleted-list** outlining the intended goals. 

- What are the exact problems that you are trying to solve?
- Avoid leading with a specific solution. Example: "Solve X" vs. "Solve X by doing Y"
- Well-defined goals can lead to many alternative solutions!

# Non-Goals 

A **concise, bulleted-list** outlining anything intentionally left out as a goal:

- Non-goal: A goal that is related, but intentionally avoided.
- Out-of-scope: A goal that is related, but intentionally avoided due to scope.
- Future: A goal that is related, but left to be addressed in the future.
- It is okay to leave this section empty or N/A.

<!--
  **Remember!** Stage 1 & 2 Proposals don't include any specific solution details.
